- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on our review of **Theater Outcomes vs Launch Date** we can conclude that Theater focused Kickstarter campaigns have the highest success rates when starting in May, but have the lowest success rate when starting in December with a steadily decreasing success rate in between.

- While this data set does give us a good picture of what to expect from a limited number of kickstarter campaigns, there are some limitations to the dataset.
    - The Kickstarter campaigns we compared in this analysis do not break down into geographic location inside of country, assuming that major cities and rural towns have different interest rates in plays, the location that Lousie is planning to launch her play could effect the outcome of her funding campaign.
    - We were only able to review a limited number of Kickstarter campaigns between 2009 and 2017. Current interest level in new plays in 2021 could be different than previous years. 

- Additional information to be explored could include:
    - Success rate of Theater/Play Kickstarter campaigns year over year.
    - Success rate of theater/Play Kickstarter campaigns in comparison to Kickstarter campaigns from different categories.
    - Alternative crowdfunding options.
